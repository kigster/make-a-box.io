          %dt Notch
          %dd The length of the notch (the width of the tabs) binding the two sides. Leave this value blank to use 3x thickness as the default.
          %dt Kerf
          %dd
            Kerf is defined as the cut width: the amount of material that laser removes while cutting. By adding a non-zero kerf you can compensate for the
            material removed, and make your box fit very snug.  But be careful: too much kerf and the sides will not fit together.  Default value is conservative at 0.007in.
          %dt Margin
          %dd is the spacing around the entire box layout
          %dt Padding
          %dd is the spacing between sides of the box as they are laid out.
          %dt Stroke
          %dd.last
            is the thickness of the line.
            %br/
            %br/
            For example,
            %strong Epilog
            laser cutter requires stroke width of 0.001 inches in order to make a cut.
